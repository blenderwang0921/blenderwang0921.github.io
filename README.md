## Introduction

I’m Blender Wang (王盈皓), a CS master’s graduate from National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University (NYCU), specializing in deep learning and algorithm development.

## Projects

### My thesis

- Title: Low-Resource High-Performance Transformer Model for Cross-Species Single-Cell Data Analysis

### SMILES Conditional Generation Model For New Psychoactive Substance (NPS) Detection

- Generate SMILES representation of molecule given it's electron ionization mass spectrometry (EI/MS)

### C++ Implementation of Sherloc

- Sherloc is a comprehensive refinement of the ACMG–AMP variant classification criteria
  - Original paper [link](https://doi.org/10.1038/gim.2017.37)
  - The authors didn't release an open source implementation
- We implemented it in C++ with some modification
  - Github [link](https://github.com/jhhung/Holmes)

### C++ Implementation of Gaussian Process Regression

- My team's final project of NYCU Parallel Programming Class
- Github [link](https://github.com/blenderwang0921/pp-final-group24)
- Support SIMD in branch [simd](https://github.com/blenderwang0921/pp-final-group24/tree/simd)

## Repositories

- [dataclass_runner](https://github.com/blenderwang0921/dataclass_runner)
  - Utilities that make dataclasses as typer cli 
- [sc_data (WIP)](https://github.com/blenderwang0921/sc_data)
  - A python library to help you build huggingface datasets from anndata / sparse matrix fast.
